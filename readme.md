                                                Ex1. "the farm problem"
In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals.
The farmer breeds three species:

* chickens = 2 legs
* cows = 4 legs
* pigs = 4 legs

The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species.
You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.

                                                Ex2. "&&"

The && operator takes two boolean values, and returns true if both values are true.

Consider a && b:

* a is checked if it is true or false.
* If a is false, false is returned.
* b is checked if it is true or false.
* If b is false, false is returned.
* Otherwise, true is returned (as both a and b are therefore true ).
  * The && operator will only return true for true && true.
